{"pTitle":"Text Game","pDesc":"Text games can be some of the most fun video games ever! What's great about text games is that it's not only super fun to play with but they are really easy to make. It's an amazing project for beginner programmers to gain more friendly experience with coding. Making a text game with python could be a great way to start. Python is a very beginner-friendly programming language and offers great tools to get you started with a text game! After learning most of the basic functions you'll need, the rest of the text game is only up to your imagination!","_id":"DVmOJ6h2CuIIAOut"}
{"pTitle":"Tic-Tac-Toe AI Bot","pDesc":"Tic-tac-toe is a simple game and coding project to easily help you dive into the world of artificial intelligence. Due to the small number of possibilities in a tic-tac-toe game, programmers can actually brute force an AI to check all possible game scenarios and choose the right one using the minimax algorithm! Starting by building a tic-tac-toe game where a player faces off against a random AI is a great way to start! If you are a beginner programmer, this is an amazing  way to hone your programming skills. Once you are complete with the game, check out Wikipedia pages or do a quick google search to find some awesome resources that explain how the minimax algorithm works. After doing your research, you should be ready to implement it into your tic-tac-toe bot.  An important component to building tic-tac-toe and a bot is knowing whether the game is in a win, lose, or draw state. Make sure you figure out how you will do this before moving too far into the project.","_id":"Da6EZoRUCVBoNLUB"}
{"pTitle":"Visual Pathfinder","pDesc":"Pathfinders are one of the best projects to learn about graphs and algorithms! Building a visual pathfinder is not only very aesthetically pleasing but also very fun!  Before starting any pathfinder project, it's important to know how exactly your pathfinder will work. What are the rules it uses to determine the shortest path. For example, are turns counted as longer paths than straight lines? It's also important to develop a strong understanding of whichever algorithm you want to implement for your pathfinder. There are so many algorithms out there, but a great way to start is by implementing Dijkstra's algorithm. It's one of the most famous algorithms with tons of resources online and it's probably one of the easiest to implement as well! You could also further enhance your visual pathfinder by building a UI that allows you to change the pathfinder settings. Whether you want users to be able to build obstacles or move around the start and destinations for the pathfinder, the possibilities are really limitless!","_id":"on1t6FQUYo7FiDRx"}
